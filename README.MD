# note_makers projects 
where I and my rotating pair partner will build a note app using just user stories and challenge targets. 

User stories and to do's 

As a developer 
notes are visable and listed, each listed note is reduced to first 20 chars - to help find the ones we want


As a developer and as a user 
I want to be able to create a new note, in order to remind myself of information that may later be useful 

As a developer 
I want to see the full note displayed on click (pop up most likley)
so i can see all the information in the note. # note_makers
